  "Introduction": "Hey everyone, Welcome to another great issue this week! Since the last issue, sad news reached us here at WeeklyXamarin HQ, about the passing of [K. Scott Allen](https://twitter.com/OdeToCode). Scott was an infamous Pluralsight course author, who helped so many developers with his courses on C#. He was also a speaker, mentor, fellow Microsoft MVP and very popular in the community. The tributes pouring in have shown just how respected and liked he was, and how much he has influenced people in their careers. Thank you for everything Scott!  Whatever you get up to this weekend, have a great time and see you next week! Luce ðŸ§¡",
