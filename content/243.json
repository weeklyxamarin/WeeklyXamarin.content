  "Introduction": "Happy Friday everyone and hope you have had a great week.   In just the blink of an eye it is almost the end of January. For me the ongoing frustration of moving house and doing home renovations is real. But soon I will have a new office to work from which I am excited about. Speaking of excitement, there is a new version of [Visual Studio 2019 16.5 Preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/visual-studio-2019-version-16-5-preview-2/) which has been released with Hot Restart for code changes.  That is definitely something to check out. Lots of great links in the newsletter this week.  Thanks to Luce who has put many of the links together for this weeks issue and as always, thanks to the community for so much great content. Have a great weekend! ❤ Kym",
