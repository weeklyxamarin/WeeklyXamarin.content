  "Introduction": "Hey everyone, Happy Friday! Sorry the newsletter is a bit later than usual. Kym is still in Seattle at \"The Mothership\" and I was on my way back from a trip too and internet wasn't my friend! A nice varied mix of links this week. As usual, thanks to everyone for their contributions! I was at NDC London last week, teaching Xamarin to a friend who works at Twilio. We had a great time and it seemed to go down well, yay! Always love sharing our love of Xamarin with new attendees. Have a great weekend and see you all next week for more fantastic Xamarin content! Luce üß°",

JIT'ed builds are far smaller, but carry the overhead of runtime method compilation. AOT builds are much larger, but generally more performant - often by a substantial margin. Ryan has a plan to try and get the best of both worlds to get the most performant compilation possible thanks to new features with Startup Tracing/Profile AOT from the Xamarin.Android team.",

Because a mobile app is not a web app, it shouldn‚Äôt depend on having a reliable internet connection 100% of the time. For example, when you open a mobile app to see the list of transactions if you don‚Äôt have internet you will only see an empty screen with ‚ÄúThere is no internet connection error‚Äù message. Won‚Äôt it be a better user experience if you could see the latest data cached? Charlin talks you through some options.",
