The straight forward version might be to provide the user with a simple form.  While the form is easy to implement and reliable, it can be cumbersome.  Why not allow the user to click on a map to set the address.  Geocoding to the rescue!

Better still, you can use FontImageSource to have scalable vector graphics used for your icons. As well as avoid all that hassle with resolution dependent images. This article also covers another interesting thing called StyleTriggers.  Not something I have personally used much, but it provides a super simple way of dynamically changing a bindable property (like a tab icon).",
