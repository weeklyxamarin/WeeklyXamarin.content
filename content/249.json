These controls are great as they have built in support for scrolling, advanced layouts, and pull-to-refresh. Sometimes, you donâ€™t need the full power of these controls and just want to repeat a control bound to a list of data. A great example is repeating categories for a conference session, profile photos, or icons. This can easily be accomplished by utilizing Bindable Layouts in Xamarin.Forms.",
