  "Introduction": "Hey everyone, Welcome back to another great issue of Weekly Xamarin, full of amazing content as ever! Thanks to everyone who contributed this week :) Corona virus continues to impact us all, but we have a reason to smile and look forward to next week as Build is here! One of the rare benefits to this pandemic is that Build has gone virtual and free, so we all have a chance to get involved and have a front of the sofa seat for all the huge announcements that are coming! Both Kym and I will be getting involved in various things going on so keep an eye on our Twitter for further news on how you can join us! I also have to add 1 to my age before we come back for next week's issue so big thanks to everyone for making this past year so good in the Xamarin community. Each year it gets better and better! Have a great weekend and most of all, Happy Build!! ðŸ§¡Luce",

He went ahead and built it on his stream over a few weeks and now it is live!",

This last one is what we will learn in this blog post.",
