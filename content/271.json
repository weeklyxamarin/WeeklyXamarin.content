      "Description": "On occasions you may find a need to display a block of HTML in your app, for a bit of legal blurb for example, and you'll reach for the trusty WebView. The WebView control is great for displaying a page of HTML, however it comes \"as is\". If a user clicks on a link within the WebView, it opens the link within the same view, but the user is unable to go back, as the WebView has no navigation controls.",

      "Description": "When creating a binding in Xamarin.Forms, the default is that you create an OneWay binding (except for input elements that have TwoWay bindings), this means that it updates the view from the ViewModel whenever the value in the ViewModel changes. But often you don't need an OneWay binding, you only need an OneTime binding, but you use OneWay just because it is the default.",
