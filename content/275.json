  "Introduction": "Hey everyone, Happy Weekend! Another quiet issue this week but hopefully that means you are with your loved ones enjoying some quality time and relaxing! If you follow me on Twitter you may have seen my Tweet about it but I have a funny story for you. On Monday I was streaming over on Twitch, working on a Xamarin.Forms app that uses Cognitive Services and I was sure my code I was porting over from an old version was right, but it wasn't returning the emotion from a face in a photo to the results page like I was expecting. Was really confused then I realised..the label text colour was white and so was the background!  Just remember this little tale if you ever find yourself hit by Imposter Syndrome. I'm qualified enough to be part of this newsletter and be a Microsoft MVP yet I failed to notice a label colour. We all make mistakes. Especially at a time when we are working from home more and not got our colleagues around to vent to as much, remember to be kind to yourselves and mistakes don't mean you're stupid, it means you're human!! Whatever you have planned, have a great week! Luce ðŸ§¡",

In this post Nick goes through a bit of a thought journey to look at some of the existing strategies for view model navigation, discuss the pros and cons, and then look at whether we can build an alternative.",

I know I am often doing it to show something I have done on Twitter, or to show an issue I am having. But did you know that the ADB command prompt will actually let you output a screenshot much faster? Mike shows you how!",
