  "Introduction": "Apologies for being a bit late with the newsletter this week but I'm sure you understand time crunches heading into the holiday season. This year has been very challenging for me and no doubt for lots of us around the world. As we head towards the holiday season I hope we can all take a moment to reflect on some of the positive parts of the year.  And celebrate the upcoming new year.  But mostly I want to take a moment to say a big thankyou for joining us in the Weekly Xamarin newsletter. And as always thankyou to all the amazing Xamarin Community authors who are putting out content for the love of it. Have a happy holiday season. ‚ù§ Kym",
