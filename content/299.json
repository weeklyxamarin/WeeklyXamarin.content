  "Introduction": "Howdy, Hope you have had a great week. I've been recovering from helping with the Ignite 2021 event where we did some great streaming on Microsoft Learn Content, which is why I've been a bit under the pump recently. But things should settle down nicely from here. We have some great articles this week, including tapping into the SpaceX data, submitting your apps to the app store, and Wifi debugging on Android. Have a great week everyone, and see you back here next week for Issue 300! ❤ Kym",
