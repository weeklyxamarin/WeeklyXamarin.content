  "Summary": "No Edition Summary",
  "Introduction": "Would you believe we are at 300 issues already?! I joined way back at issue 152 which was the 20th April 2018. We have certainly come a long way since then! We have surpassed some big subscriber milestones, seen lots of amazing content created from new and seasoned content creators, watched as the type of content created has evolved. Certainly recently we have seen an increase in podcasts and videos. Although between us over the years, Geoff, Kym and myself have been the curators, really the newsletter is powered by all of you. From the people who read the website, read emails, create content to those people who retweet and tell people about it.  So I wanted to take this moment to say a big thank you!!! Hopefully this will continue for years to come as we evolve into .NET 6 and all the MAUI changes come. We haven't forgotten and Kym and I will be making plans to evolve alongside these changes so watch this space ;) ðŸ§¡",

      "Description": "If you write Shell apps, youâ€™ll know that the mechanism for passing data between pages is to pass it as query parameters using URI-based navigation. Then, in your receiving class (be it a page, or a view model), you decorate the class with a QueryPropertyAttribute for each query parameter. This works quite well, but it can be a pain having to add a QueryPropertyAttribute for each item of data that gets passed. In addition, because each QueryPropertyAttribute sets a property, you can end up with multiple pieces of plumbing code just to receive data. So whatâ€™s the solution? Enter the oddly named IQueryAttributable interface.",
