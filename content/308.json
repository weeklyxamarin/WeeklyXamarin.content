  "Summary": "Communities, WWDC Notes, and a Weekly Xamarin App.",
  "Introduction": "It's almost the weekend and that means it's time for the Weekly Xamarin newsletter.  As always lots of great articles for the week. I particularly like the WWDC roundup and the List of World  Wide Xamarin & MAUI communities that Luis Matos has curated.  We are also pleased to announce we now have a Weekly Xamarin App.  It's a little rough around the edges, but hope you find it useful.  [Check it out here.](https://weeklyxamarin.github.io/website/) Thanks to the wonderful people who have made this happen: Lachlan Gordon, Luce Carter, Ryan Davis, David Wahid, James Montemagno, Aden Earnshaw, Sameer Mansoor and Jonathan Parker (and many others who have watched the streams of us building it).  If you want to contribute and help build it out further we accept pull requests ;-) Have a great weekend everyone. ❤ Kym",
