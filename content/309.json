Their use as a new icon format is to cater to the different shape varieties that device manufacturers like to include in their Android version. Some devices prefer round icons, whereas others might favor a rounded rectangle type design. Adaptive icons solve these discrepancies by creating a layering system, where the actual subject of your icon sits on a different layer that gets overlayed on top of a round or square icon surface.",

      "Description": "Blazor enables building client-side web UI with .NET, but sometimes you need more than what the web platform offers. Sometimes you need full access to the native capabilities of the device. You can now host Blazor components in .NET MAUI apps to build cross-platform native apps using web UI. The components run natively in the .NET process and render web UI to an embedded web view control using a local interop channel. This hybrid approach gives you the best of native and the web. Your components can access native functionality through the .NET platform, and they render standard web UI. .NET MAUI Blazor apps can run anywhere .NET MAUI can (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android) although our primary focus for .NET 6 is on desktop scenarios.",
