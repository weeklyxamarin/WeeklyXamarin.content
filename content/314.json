      "Description": "When Micros?oft first launched .NET, the vision was to offer a viable alternative to Java and the JVM - a runtime and associated language(s) that could run anywhere. With MAUI, that original dream is becoming a reality. Whether you're building for cloud, mobile, browser, desktop, IoT devices, servers, embedded systems...the list goes on and on - you can write code in .NET and it will run anywhere. With a dash of .NET, a pinch of Blazor, and a sprinkling of MAUI, you no longer need to React to any funny angles - you can have your .NET cake and eat it too. In this talk, Matt welcomes you into his full stack .NET dream, and shows you how you can build anything in .NET, and run it everywhere.",
