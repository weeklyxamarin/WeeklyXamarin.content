  "Summary": "Videos, Databases and MAUI Standup!",
  "Introduction": "Happy Friday! Is it just me, or is the community preferring to create videos over blog posts? This edition is jam-packed full of videos to check out. I would highly recommend checking out the MAUI Community Standup to keep up to date with all the great MAUI stuff heading our way. Here in Melbourne we are locked down (again) so I guess I'm going to have plenty of time to catch up on video content in between bouts of home-schooling my kids ;-) Anyway, have a magical weekend. ❤ Kym",
