  "Summary": "Design, Tools and MAUI (just not yet)",
  "Introduction": "G'day everyone. Well, you've probably heard the news that MAUI is going to have some more time baking in the oven. I for one think this is good news and I've been really pleased with the positive reception around the developer community. Much better to have a stable amazing release than hitting a timeframe. We've got a pretty big edition this week with some Design articles, lots of MAUI, and some cool tools. Have a great week everyone! ❤ Kym",
