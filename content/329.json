  "Introduction": "After the huge number of articles last week, I shouldn't be surprised that it's a little quiet around the community. The good news is that you'll have even more time to review this week's articles,  play around with .NET MAUI Preview 10 and the other announcements from dotNetConf. Speaking of great announcements, [UnoConf 2021](https://unoconf.com?utm_source=WeeklyXAM&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=UnoConf2021) is happening soon, and you should check it out. Take care everyone and have a wonderful week. ♥️ Kym",
