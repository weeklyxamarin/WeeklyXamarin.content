  "Introduction": "G'day everyone, welcome to issue #342 of Weekly Xamarin - a wrapup of the Xamarin and MAUI communities this week.  It's been quite a week and as Rhys James says \"[Genuinely humiliating to contract the novel coronavirus is March 2022. Feel like I just bought a Dreamcast.](https://twitter.com/rhysjamesy/status/1502255394500059142)\". That was my week. Looking forward to getting back into action and the next release of MAUI. ❤ Kym",
