  "Introduction": "G'day everyone, welcome to issue #345 of Weekly Xamarin - a wrap-up of the community articles around Xamarin and MAUI communities this week. It is a fairly slow week in news, but maybe that's because we are so close to a GA release of Maui. Speaking of MAUI and releases, there is a link to a full day self-paced MAUI workshop in this weeks edition, which you should check out. Have a great week everyone. ❤ Kym",
