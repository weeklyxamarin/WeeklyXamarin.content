  "Introduction": "G'day everyone, welcome to issue #346 of Weekly Xamarin - a wrap-up of the community articles around Xamarin and MAUI communities this week. Sorry for the late edition last week, but this week I have come through with the goods and released a day early ;-)  Mostly because I'm going away camping with the family over the weekend! Exciting news this week though - Maui Release Candidate has been released! So stop reading this and go download it. Until next week, take care. Kym",
