  "Summary": "Release Candidate 2 - wow, that happened fast!",
  "Introduction": "G'day everyone, welcome to issue #348 of Weekly Xamarin - a wrap-up of the community articles around Xamarin and MAUI communities this week. The big news this week is the release of RC2 of MAUI. Speaking of Release Candidates, Mac people can now have fun with the VS2022 for Mac Release Candidate too! If you live in the right time zones on May 3 there looks to be some really cool sessions happening live over on twitch at the [Snorkelling in MAUI event](https://twitter.com/Telerik/status/1519322630200901632) hosted by Sam Basu and Friends. Unfortunately, it will be the middle of the night here in Australia so I sure hope they record the sessions. But if you can make it to the sessions this should be amazing! Anyway, I hope you all have a lovely weekend and great week ahead, Kym",
